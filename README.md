# Game #01: Pong (Foxball?)

This is a variation of Pong with fox themes. While I had ideas for special gameplay variations, I felt that I shouldn't spend too much time on a single project for the 20 Games challenge, so I've settled with trying to make it look a little nicer instead.

This project utilizes the Grobold font by Guy Buhry non-commercially.
